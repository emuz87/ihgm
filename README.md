## How to disable/enable features
To disable a feature, simply comment or uncomment a line that looks like this.
```
:AddModule(ExampleModule.New(...))
```
## How to configure a feature
Configuring a feature involves changing the parameters in a constructor, for example:
```
:AddModule(ExampleModule.New(<Change these parameters>))
```
### Note
If you for some reason want to add a feature or use this module system, contact me on discord at **tom#3209** as I would like to explain how I think the best way to use it is.
